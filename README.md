# Streamlabs Chatbot Sample Script
## From KSP, we made a !jeb Command script for Chat
### create, edit, add the script
Typically, there is a directory under "[drive]:\Users\<CURRENTUSER>\AppData\Roaming\Streamlabs\Streamlabs Chatbot\Services\Scripts\"
where you can place your scripts under directories of their own. You can also add a UI_Config.json file there
to include your GUI information and make it flexible.
